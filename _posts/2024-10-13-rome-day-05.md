[^1]: Augustus (27 BCE - 14 CE) established and became the first Emperor of the Roman Empire, transforming Rome from a republic into the most powerful empire in the ancient world. 

[^2]: Germanicus was the adopted son of Tiberius, nephew of Augustus, and father of Caligula, whose popularity and military successes made him the heir apparent until his mysterious death in 19 CE. 

[^3]: Agrippa Posthumus was Augustus's only biological grandson through his daughter Julia, but was exiled by Augustus and later executed upon Tiberius's accession to power. 

[^4]: Drusus Major was Tiberius's brother, Germanicus's father, and Augustus's stepson, whose military campaigns in Germania made him a popular figure until his early death in 9 BCE. 

[^5]: Marcus Junius Brutus, though not part of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, was Julius Caesar's adopted son and most famous assassin, whose actions helped precipitate the end of the Roman Republic. 

[^6]: Nero (54-68 CE) was the last of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, known for allegedly "fiddling while Rome burned" and persecuting Christians before committing suicide. 

[^7]: Caligula (37-41 CE) started his reign with popular reforms but is remembered for his extravagance and alleged madness before being assassinated by his own guards. 

[^8]: Drusus Minor was Tiberius's only son and intended heir, whose death in 23 CE was later revealed to be murder by the Praetorian Prefect Sejanus. 

[^9]: Tiberius (14-37 CE) was Augustus' adopted son and successor who expanded the empire's borders but became increasingly reclusive in his later years on Capri. 

[^10]: Philip V of Macedon (221-179 BCE) expanded Macedonian influence through military campaigns but ultimately saw his kingdom's power diminish through conflicts with the rising Roman Republic. 

[^11]: Alexander the Great (336-323 BCE) created one of history's largest empires by age 30, conquering territories from Greece to India, and spread Hellenistic culture throughout the ancient world. 

[^12]: Antoninus Pius (138-161 CE) presided over a peaceful reign marked by economic prosperity and no major wars. 

[^13]: Lucius Verus (161-169 CE) was co-emperor with Marcus Aurelius, making them the first two emperors to rule jointly in Roman history, and led successful campaigns against Parthia before dying during a plague outbreak. 

[^14]: Marcus Aurelius (161-180 CE) was the philosopher emperor who wrote "Meditations" while defending the empire against Germanic tribes. 

[^15]: Crispina was the wife of Emperor Commodus, who initially enjoyed a privileged position as empress but was later accused of adultery and exiled to Capri, where she was eventually executed on her husband's orders. 

[^16]: Commodus (180-192 CE) ended the era of the Five Good Emperors, known for his megalomaniacal behavior and fighting as a gladiator. 

[^17]: Antinous was Emperor Hadrian's young Greek favorite and lover, whose drowning in the Nile in 130 CE led Hadrian to deify him, establish a cult in his honor, and name cities after him across the empire. 

[^18]: Hadrian (117-138 CE) built his famous wall in Britain and consolidated the empire's borders, focusing on defensive rather than expansionist policies. 

[^19]: Sabina was Emperor Hadrian's wife and empress, who despite their reportedly unhappy marriage was deified after her death and featured prominently in imperial propaganda as a symbol of family harmony. 

[^20]: Nerva (96-98 CE) began the line of the Five Good Emperors, establishing the practice of adopting a capable heir rather than relying on hereditary succession.

[^21]: Domitian (81-96 CE) was the last Flavian emperor, known for his authoritarian rule and persecution of Christians before being assassinated.

[^22]: Vespasian (69-79 CE) founded the Flavian dynasty and restored stability after the civil war, beginning construction of the Colosseum.

[^23]: Caracalla (211-217 CE) granted Roman citizenship to all free inhabitants of the empire but was known for his cruelty and was assassinated.

[^24]: Geta (209-211 CE) was co-emperor with his father Septimius Severus and brother Caracalla, until Caracalla had him murdered in their mother's arms and enacted a damnatio memoriae erasing Geta from official records.

[^25]: Septimius Severus (193-211 CE) founded the Severan dynasty and strengthened the empire's borders through successful military campaigns.

[^26]: Alexander Severus (222-235 CE) was the last of the Severan dynasty, whose assassination marked the beginning of the Crisis of the Third Century.

[^27]: Livia was the influential wife of Augustus and first Roman empress, who effectively managed the imperial household and shaped the dynasty's succession, though ancient sources debate whether her political influence was beneficial or harmful.

[^28]: Diocletian (284-305 CE) reformed the empire by establishing the Tetrarchy system of rule and implementing major economic and administrative changes.
