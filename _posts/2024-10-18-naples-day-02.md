I forgot to take a photo at our first stop on the food tour, but they served us frittatine di pasta Napoletane. Think fried mac and cheese with peas and ham included in the filling, super tasty!

Who could have guessed we'd by trying Neapolitan pizza in Naples! The freshness of the tomato sauce and cheese elevated this simple dish to something truly divine
